Event Clustering
        The goal is to automatically group photos into Events based on location (≈50m radius) 
and upload time.

        A background service/job will run periodically (cron or worker) and process only photos 
where eventId == null. Photos are first grouped into small time windows (e.g. 5–10 minutes) to 
reduce computation. Within each time window, photos are clustered by geographic distance using a 
threshold of ~50 meters (DBSCAN or geohash-based grouping).

        If a cluster contains at least 4–5 photos, a new Event is created in Event.js. The 
clustered photos are then bulk-updated with the generated eventId. If an existing event already 
exists nearby in the same time range, clusters can be merged to avoid duplicates.

For scalability, the system relies on:
        Geospatial (2dsphere) and time-based indexes
        Batch processing
        Stateless background workers
        Processing only new/unassigned photos

    This keeps uploads fast, avoids reprocessing, and allows horizontal scaling as data grows.
